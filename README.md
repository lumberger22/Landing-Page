# Landing-Page
OdinProject Landing Page Project

This is the project for the CSS portion of the OdinProject learning program. Here I will use what I have learned so far about incorperating css styles with an html structure that I create. Looking back at other projects I have done, I've come a long way in terms of my knowledge of html and css as well as my knowledge of how different languages interact with each other and depend on each other. I have also increased my knowledge of websites in general and how they are created and sustained.

I plan on using basic css styles and the flexbox structure to build this project. This means creating a flexible webpage that can expand and contract depending on how I want it to.
